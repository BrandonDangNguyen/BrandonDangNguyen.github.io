          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7</span><span class="verse-text">By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8</span><span class="verse-text">By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9</span><span class="verse-text">By faith he went to live in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10</span><span class="verse-text">For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11</span><span class="verse-text">By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12</span><span class="verse-text">Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13</span><span class="verse-text">These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14</span><span class="verse-text">For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15</span><span class="verse-text">If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16</span><span class="verse-text">But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17</span><span class="verse-text">By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son,</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18</span><span class="verse-text">of whom it was said, “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.”</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19</span><span class="verse-text">He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20</span><span class="verse-text">By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21</span><span class="verse-text">By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22</span><span class="verse-text">By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23</span><span class="verse-text">By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24</span><span class="verse-text">By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25</span><span class="verse-text">choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26</span><span class="verse-text">He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27</span><span class="verse-text">By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28</span><span class="verse-text">By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29</span><span class="verse-text">By faith the people crossed the Red Sea as on dry land, but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same, were drowned.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30</span><span class="verse-text">By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31</span><span class="verse-text">By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32</span><span class="verse-text">And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets—</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33</span><span class="verse-text">who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34</span><span class="verse-text">quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35</span><span class="verse-text">Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36</span><span class="verse-text">Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37</span><span class="verse-text">They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword. They went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated—</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38</span><span class="verse-text">of whom the world was not worthy—wandering about in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</span></div>
          <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39</span><span class="verse-text">And all these, though commended through their faith, did not receive what was promised,</span></div>

      <section>
        <p>In this session, we seek to learn three vital truths. First, how incredible faith truly is—a grace by 
          which we may draw near to God with confidence because we have a great High Priest. Second, 
          how much we need to read and treasure the Old Testament, for it reveals God’s unfolding plan 
          of redemption and showcases the examples of enduring faith. Third, we come to see how 
          astonishing faith in Christ is, especially as we recognize that the saints of old looked forward in 
          faith to promises they had not yet seen. They did not know Christ explicitly, and yet they trusted 
          in God’s word and promises.</p>
        
          <p>The inspired author of Hebrews functions as a commentator on these ancient heroes of faith, 
          showing us the character of enduring faith—that is, faith which holds fast to God and perseveres 
          to the end. This kind of faith is commended and approved by God. The audience of this epistle 
          were Hebrew Christians—Jewish believers who had come to know Christ as Messiah. Abraham, 
          the father of faith, loomed large in their cultural and religious memory. He was honored by them 
          as a model of righteousness and trust in God. And yet, even Abraham had to humbly submit 
          himself before the Lord, placing his full confidence not in himself, but in the promises of God. 
          Who are we, sinful and finite, to approach a holy God? And yet, God in His grace has made a 
          way.</p>
        
          <p><strong>Faith obeys God.</strong> True faith is not merely intellectual agreement—it acts. Abraham had a heart 
          of faith that manifested itself in obedience. Though there were times when Abraham hesitated, 
          doubted, or even disobeyed, <strong>Hebrews 11</strong> still places him among the faithful. This demonstrates 
          that faith is not perfection, but trust that leads to obedience. God speaks to us through His 
          Word, giving clear commands: to live in harmony, to be fishers of men, to abstain from sexual 
          immorality, to flee idolatry, to beware of the love of money, and not to grow weary in doing good. 
          Yet how often do we disobey? What does our inconsistency say about our faith? How selective 
          are we in choosing which commands we obey? At times, environments like college may feel like 
          “spiritual Disneyland,” filled with distractions and diversions. But our obedience must not rest on 
          external pressures or community consensus; it must be grounded in faith in a holy God.</p>
        
          <p><strong>Faith ventures into the unknown.</strong> When Abraham obeyed God’s call, he left his homeland and 
          journeyed to a foreign place. In his time, this meant uprooting his entire household—a radical 
          act of trust. When we, by faith, become more confident in God’s will than in our own plans or 
          abilities, we often find ourselves at the edge of our comfort zones. As students and thinkers, we 
          are used to having answers. But faith, if lived out genuinely, will bring us to places where we 
          don’t know the answer. Perhaps this is because God desires us to depend more on Him than on 
          our knowledge. Faith may lead us into uncomfortable conversations, uncertain career paths, 
          and situations where we must trust God moment by moment. Just as Abraham stepped into the 
          unknown, so must we.</p>
        
          <p><strong>Faith looks to eternity.</strong> It fixes its gaze on the heavenly city—the one with foundations, built by 
          God, unshakable and sure. Our hope and confidence are anchored in that eternal city. 
          <strong>Colossians 3</strong> urges us to <strong>“seek the things that are above”</strong> and to set our minds on the things of 
          Christ. Enduring faith sees the finish line and runs the race with perseverance. It is not bound to 
          the fleeting concerns of this life but lives with eternity in view. Life is meant to be lived now and 
          forever. God has promised eternal life through Christ, and faith embraces that promise with joy.</p>
        
          <p><strong>Faith believes in God’s promises against all odds.</strong> God promised Abraham that he would be 
          the father of many nations—and so he had to receive a literal son. But Sarah was barren and 
          well past childbearing age. Though there was a time when she doubted (<strong>Genesis 18</strong>), she 
          ultimately considered God faithful, and Isaac was born. Abraham’s faith triumphed over logic 
          and impossibility. When God later commanded him to offer Isaac as a sacrifice, Abraham 
          obeyed, trusting that God could even raise the dead. His faith looked beyond the immediate and 
          held to the promise.</p>
        
          <p><strong>Faith is often unfulfilled in this life.</strong> The Old Testament saints died in faith, never having seen 
          the full realization of God’s promises—specifically the coming of Christ. God’s promises are not 
          always fulfilled according to our timetable or expectations. The things we desire in this life pale 
          in comparison to the inheritance we have in Christ, secured through His perfect priesthood. He 
          who created the heavens, who sent His Son to redeem us, is faithful. Abraham was willing to 
          sacrifice Isaac because he trusted God’s character and power. Ultimately, God spared Isaac, 
          but did not spare His own Son, whom He crushed on the cross for our redemption. And just as 
          God raised Jesus from the dead, He will raise us to eternal life. The patriarchs lived faithfully 
          with an eye on the unfolding of God's plan, even if it stretched beyond their lifetimes. Joseph, at 
          the end of his life, expressed faith that God would lead Israel out of Egypt—so much so that he 
          made them promise to carry his bones with them. This generational faith reminds us that God’s 
          plan often transcends our lifespans. If His promise is not fulfilled in my generation, perhaps it 
          shall be fulfilled in the next.</p>
        
          <p><strong>Faith triumphs over fear.</strong> When Moses was born, Egypt had decreed death to all Hebrew baby 
          boys. Yet Moses’ mother, in faith, hid him for three months. Her quiet courage defied Pharaoh’s 
          command because she saw the child as precious in God’s eyes. When the basket floated down 
          the Nile and was discovered, God’s providence was at work. What would God have me do, even 
          when the cost is great? Faith does what is right in God’s sight, not man's.</p>
        
          <p><strong>Faith forsakes the world.</strong> Moses, though he could have lived in luxury as a prince of Egypt, 
          chose instead to suffer with the people of God. He gave up earthly comfort for heavenly reward. 
          How do we weigh the temporary pleasures of this life against the surpassing joy of obedience to 
          God? Moses chose mistreatment because he desired something better—eternal rest with God.</p>
        
          <p><strong>Faith is delivered by God’s power.</strong> By faith, Moses kept the Passover, leading God’s people in 
          obedience and trust. That faith was met by divine power. The Red Sea parted, Jericho’s walls 
          fell—not because of human ingenuity, but because of God’s might. Our faith is not blind or 
          wishful. It rests on the sure testimony of God’s ability to act. There is no such thing as a world 
          apart from divine intervention. When we experience deliverance in life—whether small or 
          great—do we recognize it as God’s doing? Do we give Him the credit for our conversations, our 
          breakthroughs, our provisions? Faith acknowledges that every deliverance is by His hand.</p>
        
          <p><strong>Faith saves the sinner.</strong> Rahab heard of Yahweh and received the spies in peace. Though a 
          prostitute, her faith spared her from destruction. The gospel testifies that no one is beyond the 
          reach of grace. Abraham was once an idolater. Moses rebelled. Rahab was immoral. Yet God 
          redeemed them. By faith, we are saved from the bondage of sin. On this side of the cross, as 
          we wait for Christ’s return, will we place our faith in Him? Will we draw near to God, hold fast our 
          confession, and help others do the same?</p>
        
          <p><strong>Knowledge must lead to response.</strong> The reward of faith is not comfort, but Christ. The heavenly 
          city is our inheritance—eternal redemption secured by our Savior. We, sinners, place our faith 
          not in ourselves but in Jesus Christ, the Righteous One, who gives us forgiveness of sins and 
          entrance into the presence of the Holy God.</p>
        
          <p><strong>Thanks be to God for the gift of faith. Amen.</strong></p>
