      <section>
        <h3>Faith Defined</h3>
        <p>When I hear the word love, a multitude of associations may come to mind—perhaps a favorite 
        food, a beloved person, my family, or even Grace on Campus. Similarly, when I ponder 
        the word hope, I might think of future aspirations like graduate school, a job offer, a long-awaited 
        reunion, the mending of a broken friendship, or simply finishing the quarter well. But what 
        comes to mind when I think about the word faith?</p>
        
        <p>This is the heart of our inquiry. We must return to Scripture to rediscover what faith truly is. 
        Many today misunderstand faith, especially under the influence of the “word of faith” movement, 
        which falsely teaches that if we possess the right amount of faith, we will inevitably prosper. If 
        we do not prosper, then perhaps we are lacking faith. This view distorts the biblical meaning of 
        faith and reduces it to a transactional formula.</p>
        
        <p>True, genuine, saving faith is not about getting what we want. It is not a spiritual commodity we 
        use to secure personal success. Rather, it is the means by which we cling to God, even in 
        suffering and uncertainty. If our understanding of faith is vague or self-centered, we make 
        ourselves vulnerable to sin and deception. The context of Hebrews helps us locate the meaning 
        of faith within God’s redemptive history. <strong>Hebrews 9</strong> presents Christ as the sufficient and final 
        sacrifice. <strong>Hebrews 10</strong> exhorts us to draw near to God, to hold fast to our confession because we 
        have been reconciled through Christ—past, present, and future. Then <strong>Hebrews 11</strong> gives us 
        examples of those who, throughout redemptive history, held fast to God by faith.</p>
        
        <p>As <strong>Habakkuk 2:4</strong> declares, <strong>“Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him, but the 
        righteous shall live by his faith.”</strong> It is faith in Christ that preserves us to the end. Such faith does 
        not rest on human sight but on the sure promises of God.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hebrews 11:1</strong> defines faith as <strong>“the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not 
        seen.”</strong> Faith is first described as assurance—a firm confidence in what we hope for, rooted not 
        in wishful thinking, but in the surety of God's promises. The believer's assurance is in Jesus 
        Christ, our Great High Priest, who has completed all that was required for reconciliation with 
        God. The “things hoped for” are truths not yet fulfilled, but assured nonetheless. Faith is 
        certainty that what God has promised will indeed come to pass. It is a great blessing to live on 
        this side of the cross, having seen in fullness what the saints of old only glimpsed from afar.</p>
        
        <p>Faith is also the <strong>“conviction of things not seen.”</strong> This conviction goes beyond intellectual 
        assent—it involves the rebuke of doubt and the embracing of unseen spiritual realities. We live 
        in an earthly realm, unable to see with physical eyes the fullness of the spiritual realm. And yet, 
        we believe. Though we cannot see, touch, or taste these things, we remain confident that God 
        will keep His word. Faith assures us that the invisible promises of God are no less real than the 
        visible world.</p>
        
        <p>True faith is centered on what God has promised, not what I want. It hears the Word of God and 
        responds with humble obedience. The question is not whether God's Word is about me, but 
        whether I will respond to it in faith. Will I hold fast to Jesus, or will I let Him slip from my grasp? 
        Hebrews exhorts us to hold fast and draw near to Jesus, for He is the substance of our hope. As 
        <strong>1 John 1:1–4</strong> proclaims, Christ has been made manifest, and all that remains for us is to come 
        to Him in faith.</p>
        
        <h3>Faith Demonstrated</h3>
        
        <p>In <strong>Hebrews 11:2</strong>, the author writes, <strong>“For by it the people of old received their commendation.”</strong> The Old 
        Testament saints were not commended by the world, but by God. Faith receives divine 
        approval—not necessarily temporal rewards, but the promise of eternal life and entrance into 
        the heavenly city. They trusted God's promises even though they received far less revelation 
        than we do today. God spoke to them through prophets; we have the full counsel of Scripture. 
        Their faith challenges us to respond with even greater humility and obedience.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hebrews 11:3</strong> illustrates how faith operates in the mind and heart of the believer. <strong>“By faith we 
        understand that the universe was created by the word of God.”</strong> No one witnessed the act of 
        creation, yet we believe because God has told us so. The visible world was formed by the 
        invisible Word of God. He spoke, and it came to be. We do not affirm this blindly, but by 
        faith—because the Creator Himself has testified to it. If we cannot believe by faith that God 
        created the world, how will we believe the greater truths of redemption? It is the same God who 
        made the heavens who also gave His Son to die for our sins.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hebrews 11:4</strong> presents Abel as the first example of a faithful man. <strong>Genesis 4</strong> tells us that God 
        accepted Abel’s offering, but not Cain’s. Why? Because Abel offered his gift in faith. God looked 
        not merely at the outward offering but at the heart of the worshiper. Abel’s sacrifice was 
        accepted because it was offered in obedience and reverence. Though he died, his faith still 
        speaks. He lived <em>coram Deo</em>—before the face of God—not merely outwardly, but inwardly, in a 
        life shaped by trust in God.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hebrews 11:5</strong> introduces Enoch, who, unlike Abel, did not see death. <strong>Genesis 5</strong> tells us that <strong>“Enoch 
        walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.”</strong> His life was a testimony of faith. He did not 
        perform great miracles or feats, but simply walked with God. That walk was enough for God to 
        commend him. We are called to the same kind of life: walking in the newness of life (<strong>Romans 
        6:4</strong>), walking worthy of our calling (<strong>Ephesians 4</strong>). <strong>“Without faith it is impossible to please God” 
        (Hebrews 11:6)</strong>. The way to God is through faith alone. By grace we are saved through faith, 
        and through faith we are justified and granted peace with God (<strong>Romans 5:1</strong>).</p>
        
        <p>Finally, <strong>Hebrews 11:7</strong> gives us the example of Noah. <strong>Genesis 6</strong> tells us that Noah, seeing the 
        wickedness of man, obeyed God's command to build an ark. He did so <strong>“in reverent fear,”</strong> even 
        though the idea of a flood seemed absurd to others. He acted on God's Word with confidence 
        and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith. Noah’s obedience condemned the 
        world, not because he judged others, but because his faithful response to God exposed the 
        unbelief around him. His life is a powerful example of faith that trusts, obeys, and endures.</p>
        
        <p>Faith is a firm confidence in God’s promises that manifests in humble obedience. It is not merely 
        belief, but belief that acts. Do I have this kind of faith? Am I sure? And if I am sure, am I really 
        sure? Jesus said that all it takes is faith the size of a mustard seed. We do not live by bread 
        alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God (<strong>Matthew 4:4</strong>). Therefore, in 
        every waking moment, we must live in light of what God has said, and respond in faith.</p>
