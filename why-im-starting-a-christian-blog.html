      <h2>Why I'm Starting a Christian Blog</h2>
      <p class="meta"><em>April 23, 2025</em></p>
      
      <p>I am starting a blog because I feel like I sound too catechistic in real life, and I'm better able to express my genuine thoughts through writing. Honestly, I often struggle to communicate my thoughts clearly (skill issue, I guess), so I think writing things down in article form will help me clarify my understanding of theology and better express what I actually believe.</p>

      <p>Writing has personally been a way for me to meditate on the Bible and reflect on my walk with God. Capturing my thoughts through text has helped me discern Scripture and process what's truly been on my heart. It's definitely tempting to passively read a passage and move on without your mind being renewed, which I'll confess I often do. That's why I write: to actually absorb the transformative power of Scripture. (That's just me personally though. If you're someone who can simply read a passage and immediately take it to heart, mind, and soul, I genuinely applaud you.)</p>

      <p>There's also a practical side to this. I want a personalized space to record my devotionals and reflections. While there are great tools out there like Obsidian, WordPress, and Notion, I want full autonomy over how my writing is structured and presented. (Full autonomy of what I create, not full autonomy from God, of course.) I think building a personalized website is one way I can be a good steward of this gift.</p>

      <p>My goal for this blog is to organize everything in a way that's helpful for others, so that they might be encouraged, convicted, or simply feel less alone in their daily battles against sin. I'm often reminded of <span class="scripture">1 Peter 5:8–9: "Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world."</span> So many of our trials are shared, and it's a blessing to rejoice in that truth. We are not alone in our sufferings. We can stand firm in the faith, knowing we are all enduring all sorts of common afflictions experienced through the whole church.</p>

      <p>And I love the next verse as well:<br>
      <span class="scripture">"And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will Himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you." 1 Peter 5:10.</span> Our trials are temporary, and Christ Himself will call us into eternal glory. But for now, let's press on together in fellowship, constantly encouraging one another to run the race well.</p>

      <p>As for what I plan to post, I'll mainly be writing devotionals and sharing weekly or biweekly updates, just talking about life and what God is teaching me. There are a lot of features I'd like to add to this site (such as making my website more mobile friendly), but I'm taking it one step at a time. Proverbs 16:9 moment.</p>

      <p>In terms of what translation I plan to use, I'm most likely going to go with the English Standard Version, since that's the one most people at GOC use. I might dabble in the KJV and LSB though, KJV because the language is so meticulously beautiful through its archaic poetry and reverent tone, and LSB because it's the most literal translation with high textual precision and accuracy from the original Bible manuscripts.</p>

      <p>This is my first ever blog, so it's all new to me. We'll see where God takes this.<br>
      Anyway, if you've read this far, thank you for checking out my blog. The site is pretty barebones right now, but I'm working hard to improve it for the glory of God. I'm excited to see how this all unfolds in accordance with His will. I truly hope this blog will be helpful to you all!</p>
